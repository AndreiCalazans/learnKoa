### Getting started with flow

* you need a parser 
  - babel-preset-flow
  - babel-cli

  just add this below to your babelrc file.
``` 
  "presets": ["flow"]
```

once you have the above install run the following commands
`yarn add flow-bin --dev`
`flow init` // creates a flow config file
`yarn run flow`  // run flow checker

make sure you install an flow extension in your IDE.
